## Overview

The Window API is used to create a new browser window.

### Constructor
```javascript
new ssf.Window(url, name, features)
```
Creates a new window. If a window with the same name already exists, that window will be reused.  
_Note:_ Window resuse is platform dependant. The API is [inconsistent between browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) and Electron only allows this for windows created via the built in `window.open()` method (child windows), not `new BrowserWindow()` that is used to implement this API.

To get the current window object, use:
```javascript
ssf.Window.getCurrentWindow()
```

### Parameters
**url**  
URL to open in the window. Must be prefixed with the protocol (i.e. http://).

**name**  
Name of the new window. Should not contain whitespace.

**features (optional)**  
Object to set features of the new window (non browser only).  
* `alwaysOnTop: boolean` - whether the window is always on top of other windows.
* `backgroundColor: string` - set the backgroundColor of the window before the page loads.
* `child: boolean` - make the new window a child of the current window.
* `frame: boolean` - create the new window with a frame.
* `maxHeight: number` - sets the maximum height of the window.
* `maximizable: boolean` - whether the window can be maximized.
* `maxWidth: number` - sets the maximum width of the window.
* `minHeight: number` - sets the minimum height of the window.
* `minimizable: boolean` - whether the window can be minimized.
* `minWidth: number` - sets the minimum width of the window.
* `resizable: boolean` - whether the window is resizable.
* `transparent: boolean` - make the window transparent. Clicks are not registered through the transparent window in Electron.

### Return Value
**window**  
A reference to the new window.
