# ContainerJS API for OpenFin

This project provides an implementation of ContainerJS which follows the Symphony Desktop Wrapper API Specification for OpenFin

## Usage

Add this package to your OpenFin project:

```
npm install ssf-desktop-api-openfin --save
```

You need to include this code into the project by loading the JavaScript file directly (as OpenFin does not support preloading).
