# Symphony API for Openfin

This project provides an implementation of the Symphony Desktop Wrapper API Specification for Openfin

## Usage

Add this package to your openfin project:

```
npm install ssf-desktop-api-openfin --save
```

You need to include this code into the project by loading the javascript file directly (as Openfin does not support preloading).
